- guidance for users on how to input search keywords ("cozy" or "cafe, quiet")
- way for users to specify location radius/bounding box for searching (so that we don't search the whole map (hadley cannot afford all those api calls))
- user profile
  - "liked"/bookmarked places
  - "disliked" places
  - user's ratings of places (-3 - 3) for ranking algorithm
  - saved places?
- way to opt into automatic location finder (another google api) so the user won't have to set a specific location/bounding box for searching
- ranking based on weather (also depends on automatic location finder)
